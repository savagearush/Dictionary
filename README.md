# Wordome : A JavaScript Dictionary Web App

**Wordome** is online Dictionary Web Application which is based on REST API. This application actually made by languages so called HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. It is not just any Dictionary, this application has been only not only to search some words, off course you can search do it anywhere on the web but this actually gives you an attractive User Interface which I hope will like the most against other available dictionary out there.

**Wordome** includes several APIs such as **Free Dictionary API** which is pool of words, you can request you query which is your word in this case and this will response you with their meaning as a response. It’s simple Isn’t it? In addition to it, there is one more API which I would like to introduce is actually pays major part in UI of this Wordome Dictionary App, **Giphy API** which is an Application Programming Interface, acronym for API which is used to fetch interesting gifs which you can definitely see down above in image.
